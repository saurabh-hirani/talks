### terraform-workshop

Slides of Terraform workshop conducted by me.

#### Workshop assignments

- [here](https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/terraform-workshop)

#### How were these slides created?

- I initially used [golang present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present) i.e. write [.slide file](https://github.com/golang/talks/blob/master/2017/state-of-go.slide) and view [the online presentation](https://talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go-may.slide#1)
- It was good enough but I ran into [these](http://saurabh-hirani.github.io/writing/2018/03/02/go-present-and-latex) limitations
- [LaTeX Beamer](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Beamer) came to the rescue!
- I wrote [terraform-workshop.tex](terraform-workshop.tex) and generated [terraform-workshop.pdf](terraform-workshop.pdf) from it.
