      "The aim of this post is describe the evolution of a program which automates docstring testing of a module and its components (functions, classes, nested classes and their respective methods). It starts out simple and as we keep on noticing limitations - we keep on making incremental changes to address those limitations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I am using an ipython notebook, I don't want the end user to copy paste and run the cell source code to try the code examples outside of the notebook. So I am using the %load ipython magic to load the source files from my ipython directory instead of typing code directly in the cells. These files map to the supporting github repo of this post - https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/talks/tree/master/docstrings - So to use code separately, clone this repo and you are good to run t1.py, t2.py and so on. Read from here, play from there.\n",
